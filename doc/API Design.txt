-Order-
Olle puts down his glass in a glass slot and remembers which glass-slot-id.
Olle selects which drink-slot is his.
Olle browses available drink-recipes, selects a recipe and presses order.
Robot places work in scheduler and starts working.
There is an indication that the drink is finished and waiting for pick-up.
When the glass is removed, the system tags the position as free.

1. {{"recipe-id":3, "drink-slot":2]]
    {{"recipe-id":3, "drink-slot":2]]

2. Task(Position.Grab(0))
    Task(Position.Pour(2))
    Task(Position.Release(0))
    Task(Position.Grab(1))
    Task(Position.Pour(2))
    Task(Position.Release(1))

Optimizations: Grab is a precondition for Pour, which means that if grab is already done 
then no need for it. If I want to do X then depending on which state the world is in then
I will need to do a bunch of extrinsic tasks before(pre-extrinsic) and perhaps after(post-extrinsic).

Lets say I want to know the cost of Pour A into B, this requires knowledge of what is needed 
to transition between states. Pour requires Bottle A Grip, Bottle A Grip requires Free Gripper.

State				|	Action					|	Pre-requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------
Bottle X Gripped		Grab Bottle X				Lid open, Gripper Free.
Gripper Free			Release Current Bottle		Lid open, Bottle X Gripped
Pour Bottle X at Y  	Pour Y						Bottle X Gripped
Lid Open				Open Lid					Gripper Free
Lid Closed				Close Lid					Gripper Free

Check each possible order and get cost:

Grab Bottle X <- Lid Open (if not, Open Lid)
			  <- Gripper Free
			  
Open Lid <- Gripper free (if not, Release Current Bottle)
Release Current Bottle 

Heuristics For JobCoordinator:

Holding a bottle: 

= State:Holding Bottle =
If any other Job has that bottle as next action, if so, do them, else, return bottle.

= State:Idle =
Ask JobCoordinator for something to do.
