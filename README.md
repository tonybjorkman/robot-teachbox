# robot-teachbox
Virtual teaching box for Melfa Movemaster industrial robotic arm.

This is a console application which will send serial output according to the legacy Melfa Basic V commands for basic robot movements. 
This enables easy jogging of a robot without the physical teaching box connected and instead using a computer keyboard.
